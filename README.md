# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
New york is an expensive city and attracts lot of travellers in a year due to business and for pleasure. It comprises of five boroughs with different cultures and character.

Hence, this project helped me find answer to questions like:
What type of airbnb listings are prevelent in terms of type of property and room typology? 
Relationship of prices with other variables.
Rationale behind price levels for different listings.
Which neighbourhood has most beds or accomodations and why?

## Process
Loaded and tried to read the data from data source section in tableau
Checked for NULL values and duplicates through ISNULL and Count LOD
Perfomed basic EDA on dataset to understand further.
Created various visualizations to present my findings

## Results
Option 2: Airbnb Dataset.
Questions:
What type of airbnb listings are prevelent in terms of type of property and room typology? 
Relationship of prices with other variables.
Rationale behind price levels for different listings.
Which neighbourhood has most beds or accomodations and why?
Visualizations are explained in PDF attached.


## Challenges 

Cleaning and EDA for null and duplicates

Understanding visual graphs and depictions and finding cause for it. 


## Future Goals
Learn multiple methods for cleaning data in tableau.
Perform hypothesis on variables to study relationship
